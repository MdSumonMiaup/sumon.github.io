00:06
Hi guys, my name is Aarya and I'm going
00:08
to be your instructor for this course today.
00:11
So in this Ethical Hacking full course video,
00:13
we'll be learning almost everything that is required
00:15
for you to get started as an Ethical Hacker.
00:18
So come let's quickly go over the topics
00:20
that we are going to be covering today firstly.
00:22
We're going to be going to the basics of cyber security
00:25
and cryptography
00:25
where we'll be learning the key concepts
00:28
of confidentiality integrity and availability
00:30
and how the cryptography Concepts also tie
00:32
into the whole picture next.
00:34
We'll be looking at some cyber threats.
00:36
We be seeing
00:37
how the Cyber threads actually affect our computer
00:39
and then we will also see how we can mitigate them.
00:42
After which we will be looking
00:44
into the history of ethical hacking.
00:46
We learn how this all began
00:47
in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
00:49
And then we will be looking into the fundamentals
00:52
of networking and ethical hacking in this will be learning
00:55
the various tools
00:56
that are used
00:57
in ethical hacking and also the network architectures.
01:00
These tools are used in after this.
01:02
We will be having a look
01:03
into what the most famous operating systems
01:05
that is there.
01:06
That is Kali Linux.
01:07
Kali Linux is used by ethical hackers
01:09
and penetration testers all
01:11
around the world will be learning
01:12
how to install this
01:13
on our local systems will be learning the tools
01:16
that come along with it
01:17
and Bash we should be using them after that.
01:19
We'll be learning about penetration testing
01:22
and penetration.
01:22
Testing is a subset of ethical hacking.
01:25
So in this we will be learning about a tool called Metasploit
01:28
and using Metasploit will be learning.
01:30
Learn more about vulnerability analysis and how we
01:32
can install back doors in different computer systems
01:35
and take advantages
01:36
of these vulnerabilities now nmap is also another tool
01:40
that we are going to be discussing in this course,
01:42
we will be learning
01:43
how we can use nmap to gather information
01:45
from our networks and
01:46
how we can use this information to our advantage after that.
01:49
We'll be learning deeply about three cyber attacks
01:52
that are there in this industry first
01:54
is cross-site scripting secondly distributed denial of service
01:58
and thirdly SQL injection attacks.
02:00
Now we be doing these attacks ourselves on dummy targets
02:03
and learning more about these attacks
02:04
and how they are orchestrated and thus we will be learning
02:07
more about how we can mitigate them.
02:09
If we actually become ethical hackers now,
02:12
we will also be discussing
02:13
some very Advanced cryptography methods called steganography,
02:16
which is basically used for hiding digital code
02:19
inside images last but not the least we will be also discussing
02:22
how you could become an ethical hacker yourself.
02:25
So we'll be discussing a roadmap will also
02:27
be discussing the job profiles that are there in the industry.
02:29
Re and we will also be discussing the companies
02:31
that are hiring for these job profiles along with the salaries
02:34
that they are trying to offer.
02:36
Also, we won't be leaving hanging right there will also
02:39
be discussing the 50 most common interview questions
02:41
that come along with these job profiles
02:43
so that you can snag
02:44
that job interview and if you do like our content in the end,

community of learners.
03:01
It can be rightfully said
03:03
that today's generation lives on the internet
03:05
and we generally users are almost ignorant as to
03:08
how those random bits of ones
03:09
and zeros Rich securely to a computer.
03:12
It's not magic its work and sweat that makes sure
03:15
that your packets reach to you on sniffed today Ira ball
03:18
from at Eureka.
03:19
I'm here to tell you guys about how cybersecurity makes
03:22
this all possible now
03:23
before we begin let me brief you all about the topics
03:26
that we're going to cover today.
03:27
So basically we're going to ask three questions.
03:29
Options that are important
03:30
to cybersecurity firstly we're going to see why
03:33
cyber security is needed next we're going to see
03:35
what exactly is cyber security
03:37
and in the end I'm going to show you also a scenario
03:39
how cybersecurity can save a whole organization
03:42
from organized cybercrime.
03:44
Okay.
03:44
So let's get started.
03:46
Now as I just said we are living in a digital era
03:49
whether it be booking a hotel room ordering some dinner
03:52
or even booking a cab.
03:53
We're constantly using the internet and inherently
03:56
constantly generating data this data is generally He
03:59
stored on the cloud
04:01
which is basically a huge data server or data center
04:04
that you can access online.
04:05
Also, we use an array
04:07
of devices to access this data now for a hacker.
04:10
It's a golden age
04:11
with so many access points public IP addresses
04:14
and constant traffic
04:15
and tons of data to exploit black hat hackers are having
04:18
one hell of a time exploiting vulnerabilities
04:21
and creating malicious software
04:23
for the same above that cyber attacks are evolving
04:25
by the day hackers are becoming smarter
04:28
and more creative with their malware's.
04:29
And how they bypass virus scans
04:31
and firewalls still baffled many people.
04:33
Let's go through some of the most common types
04:36
of cyber attacks now,
04:37
so as you guys can see I've listed out eight cyber attacks
04:40
that have plagued us since the beginning of the internet.
04:43
Let's go through them briefly.
04:44
So first on the list,
04:46
we have General malware's malware is
04:48
an all-encompassing term for a variety of cyber threats
04:51
including Trojans viruses
04:53
and worms malware is simply defined as code
04:55
with malicious intent
04:57
that typically steals data or destroy.
04:59
On the computer next on the list.
05:01
We have fishing often posing as a request for data
05:04
from a trusted third party phishing attacks are sent
05:07
via email and ask users to click on a link
05:10
and enter the personal data phishing emails have gotten
05:13
much more sophisticated in recent years making it difficult
05:16
for some people to discern a legitimate request
05:19
for information from a false one phishing emails often fall
05:23
into the same category as spam but are more harmful
05:25
than just a simple ad next on the list.
05:28
We have password attacks.
05:29
It's a password attack is exactly what it sounds
05:32
like a third party trying to gain access to your system.
05:35
My tracking a user's password.
05:37
Next up is DDOS
05:38
which stands for distributed denial-of-service
05:41
DDOS attack focuses
05:42
on disrupting the service of a network a darker send
05:45
High volumes of data
05:46
or traffic through the network
05:47
that is making a lot of connection requests
05:50
until the network becomes overloaded
05:52
and can no longer function next up.
05:54
We have man-in-the-middle attacks by impersonating
05:57
the endpoint in an online information.
05:59
That is the connection from your smartphone
06:01
to a website the MIT.
06:03
Emma docs can obtain information from the end users and entity he
06:07
or she is communicating with for example,
06:09
if your Banking online the man in the middle
06:12
would communicate with you by impersonating your bank
06:15
and communicate with the bank by impersonating you the man
06:17
in the middle would then receive all the information transferred
06:20
between both parties
06:21
which could include sensitive data such as
06:24
bank accounts and personal information next up.
06:26
We have drive-by downloads through malware on a Ledge.
06:29
Emmett website a program
06:31
is downloaded to a user system just by visiting the site.
06:34
It doesn't require any type of action
06:36
by the user to download it actually next up.
06:38
We have mail advertising
06:40
which is a way to compromise your computer
06:42
with malicious code
06:43
that is downloaded to your system
06:45
when you click on an effective ad lastly,
06:47
we have Rogue softwares,
06:48
which are basically malware's
06:50
that are masquerading as
06:51
legitimate and necessary security software
06:54
that will keep your system safe.
06:56
So as you guys can see
06:57
now the internet sure isn't the safe place.
06:59
As you might think it is this not only applies
07:02
for us as individuals.
07:03
But also large organizations.
07:05
They're having multiple cyber breaches in the past
07:08
that has compromised the privacy and confidentiality of a data.
07:11
If we head over to the site called information is beautiful.
07:14
We can see all the major cyber breaches
07:16
that have been committed.
07:18
So as you guys can see even big companies like eBay,
07:22
AOL Evernote Adobe have actually gone
07:25
through major cyber breaches,
07:27
even though they have a lot of security measures taken
07:29
to protect the data that they contain
07:32
so it's not only
07:33
that small individuals are targeted by hackers
07:36
and other people
07:37
but even bigger organizations are constantly being targeted
07:41
by these guys.
07:42
So after looking at all sorts
07:43
of cyberattacks possible the breaches of the past
07:46
and the sheer amount of data available.
07:48
We must be thinking
07:49
that there must be some sort of mechanism and protocol
07:52
to actually protect us from all these sorts of cyberattacks
07:55
and indeed there is a way
07:57
and this is called cyber security in
07:59
a Computing context security comprises of cybersecurity
08:02
and physical security.
08:04
Both are used by Enterprises to protect
08:06
against unauthorized access to data centers
08:08
and other computerized systems information security,
08:12
which is designed to maintain the confidentiality integrity
08:14
and availability of data is
08:16
a subset of cybersecurity the use of cyber.
08:18
Cybersecurity can help prevent
08:20
against cyberattacks data breaches identity theft
08:23
and can Aid in Risk Management.
08:25
So when an organization has a strong sense
08:27
of network security
08:28
and an effective incident response plan,
08:31
it is better able to prevent
08:33
and mitigate these attacks for example
08:35
and user protection defense information and guards
08:38
against loss of theft
08:39
while also scanning computers for malicious code.
08:42
Now when talking about cybersecurity,
08:44
there are three main activities
08:45
that we are trying to protect ourselves against and they
08:48
are Unauthorized modification unauthorised deletion
08:52
and unauthorized access.
08:53
These freedoms are
08:54
very synonymous to the very commonly known CIA Triad
08:58
which stands for confidentiality integrity and availability.
09:03
The CIA Triad is also
09:04
commonly referred to as a three pillars of security
09:07
and more security policies of bigger organizations.
09:10
And even smaller companies are based on these three principles.
09:13
So let's go through them one by one.
09:16
So first on the list we have
09:18
confidentiality confidentiality is roughly equivalent
09:21
to privacy measures undertaken to ensure
09:23
confidentiality are designed to prevent sensitive information
09:27
from reaching the wrong people
09:28
while making sure that the right people
09:30
can in fact get it access must be restricted.
09:33
To those authorized to view the data in question
09:36
in as common as well for data to be categorized
09:39
according to the amount
09:40
and type of damage
09:41
that could be done.
09:42
Should it fall into unintended hands more
09:45
or less stringent measures can then be implemented across
09:49
to those categories?
09:50
Sometimes safeguarding data confidentiality meanwhile
09:53
special training for those privy
09:55
to such documents
09:56
such training would typically include security risks
09:59
that could threaten this information training
10:01
can help familiarize ourselves.
10:02
Her eyes people with risk factors
10:04
and how to guard against them further aspects of training
10:07
can include strong password
10:09
and password related best practices
10:11
and information about social engineering methods to prevent
10:14
them from bending data handling rules
10:16
with good intention
10:17
and potentially disastrous results.
10:19
Next on list.
10:20
We have integrity Integrity involves maintaining
10:23
the consistency accuracy
10:24
and trustworthiness of data
10:26
over its entire lifecycle data must not be changed in transit
10:30
and steps must be taken to ensure that data.
10:33
Cannot be altered by
10:34
unauthorized people for example in a breach of confidentiality.
10:38
These measures include
10:39
file permissions and user access controls Version Control
10:43
may be used to prevent are honest changes
10:45
or accidental deletion
10:47
by authorized users becoming a problem.
10:49
In addition.
10:50
Some means must be in place to detect any changes in data
10:53
that might occur as a result
10:54
of non-human caused events such as electromagnetic pulses
10:58
or server crash
10:59
some data might include checksums even cryptography.
11:02
Graphic checksums for verification of Integrity backup
11:05
or redundancies must be available to restore
11:08
the affected data to its correct State last
11:11
but not least is availability availability is best ensured
11:14
by rigorous maintaining
11:16
of all Hardware performing Hardware repairs immediately
11:18
when needed and maintaining
11:20
a correctly functional operating system environment
11:22
that is free of software conflicts.
11:24
It's also important to keep current with all necessary
11:27
system upgrades providing adequate communication bandwidth
11:31
and preventing the occurrences
11:33
of Bottlenecks are equally important redundancy failover
11:36
and even higher availability clusters can mitigate
11:39
serious consequences
11:40
when hardware issues do occur fast in
11:42
as adaptive Disaster Recovery is essential
11:45
for the worst-case scenarios
11:47
that capacity is reliant on the existence
11:49
of a comprehensive Disaster Recovery plan safeguards
11:52
against data loss
11:53
or interruption in connection
11:55
must include unpredictable events such as natural disasters
11:59
and file to prevent data loss
12:00
from such occurrences a backup copy.
12:02
He must be stored in a geographically
12:04
isolated location,
12:05
perhaps even in a fireproof water safe place
12:08
extra security equipments or software such as firewalls
12:11
and proxy servers
12:12
and goddess against down times
12:14
and unreachable data you
12:16
to malicious actions such as denial-of-service attacks
12:19
and network intrusions.
12:20
So now that we have seen what we are actually trying to implement
12:24
when trying to protect ourselves on the internet.
12:26
We should also know the ways
12:27
that we actually protect ourselves
12:29
when we are attacked by cyber organizations.
12:32
So the Step to actually mitigate any type of Cyber attack is
12:35
to identify the malware or the Cyber threat
12:37
that is being currently going on in your organization.
12:40
Next.
12:41
We have to actually analyze
12:42
and evaluate all the affected parties
12:44
and the file systems
12:45
that have been compromised
12:47
and in the end we have to patch the hole treatment
12:50
so that our organization can come back
12:52
to its original running State without any cyber breaches.
12:55
So how is it exactly done?
12:57
This is mostly done by actually calculating three factors.
13:01
The first factor is vulnerable.
13:02
Leti the second factor is threat and the third is risk.
13:06
So let me tell you about the three of them a little bit.
13:09
So first on the list
13:10
of actual calculation is we have vulnerability.
13:13
So a vulnerability refers to a known weakness of an asset
13:16
that can be exploited by one or more attackers.
13:19
In other words.
13:20
It is a known issue
13:21
that allows an attack to be successful.
13:24
For example,
13:24
when a team member resigns and you forget to disable
13:27
their access to external accounts change logins
13:29
or remove their names
13:30
from the company credit cards this leaves.
13:33
Your business open
13:34
to both unintentional and intentional threats.
13:37
However, most vulnerabilities are exploited by automated tacos
13:41
and not a human typing on the other side
13:43
of the network.
13:45
Next testing for vulnerabilities
13:47
is critical to ensuring the continued security
13:49
of your systems by identifying weak points
13:52
and developing a strategy to respond quickly.
13:54
Here are some questions
13:56
that you ask when determining your security vulnerabilities.
13:59
So you have questions like is your data backed up
14:02
and stored in a secure off-site location is your data stored
14:05
in the cloud if yes,
14:07
how exactly is it being protected
14:08
from cloud vulnerabilities?
14:10
What kind of security do you have to determine
14:13
who can access modify
14:14
or delete information from within your organization next
14:17
like you could ask questions
14:19
like what kind of antivirus protection is in use?
14:22
What is the license currents are the license current?
14:25
And is it running as often as needed?
14:27
Also, do you have a data recovery plan
14:29
in the event of vulnerability being exploited?
14:32
These are the normal questions
14:34
that one asks when actually checking their vulnerability.
14:37
Next up is thread a thread refers to a new or newly
14:40
discovered incident with potential to do harm to a system
14:44
or your overall organization.
14:46
There are three main types
14:47
of thread National threats like floods
14:49
or tornadoes unintentional threats such as employee
14:52
mistakingly accessing the wrong information
14:55
and intentional threats.
14:57
There are many examples
14:58
of intentional threats including spyware malware advert companies
15:02
or the Actions of disgruntled employees in addition worms
15:05
and viruses are categorized
15:07
as threats because they could potentially cause harm
15:10
to your organization through exposure to an automated attack
15:13
as opposed to one perpetrated by human beings.
15:16
Although these threats are generally outside
15:19
of one's control and difficult to identify in advance.
15:22
It is essential to take appropriate measures to assess
15:25
threats regularly here are some ways to do so and sure
15:28
that your team members are staying informed
15:30
of current trends
15:31
in cyber security so they can The identify new threats,
15:34
they should subscribe to blogs like wired and podcast
15:37
like the Tech janek's Extreme it
15:39
that covers these issues
15:40
as well as join professional associations,
15:43
so they can benefit
15:44
from breaking news feeds conferences and webinars.
15:47
You should also perform regular threat assessment
15:49
to determine the best approaches to protecting a system
15:52
against the specific threat along with assessing
15:54
different types of thread in addition penetration,
15:57
testing involves modeling real-world threats in order
16:00
to discover vulnerabilities next on the List,
16:03
we have risk.
16:04
So risk refers to the potential for loss or damage
16:07
when a threat exploits a vulnerability examples
16:10
of risks include Financial losses as a result
16:13
of business disruption loss
16:14
of privacy reputational damage legal implications
16:17
and can even include loss
16:19
of life risk can also be defined as follows,
16:21
which is basically threat X the vulnerability you
16:24
can reduce the potential for Risk by creating
16:27
and implementing a risk management plan.
16:29
And here are the key aspects to consider When developing
16:32
your Management strategy firstly we need to assess risk
16:35
and determine needs
16:36
when it comes to designing
16:38
and implementing a risk assessment framework.
16:40
It is critical to prioritize the most important breaches
16:43
that need to be addressed all the frequency May differ
16:46
in each organization.
16:47
This level of assessment must be done
16:49
on a regular recurring basis.
16:51
Next.
16:51
We also have to include
16:52
a total stakeholder perspective stakeholders include
16:55
the business owners as well as employees customers
16:58
and even vendors all of these players
17:00
have the potential to negatively impact.
17:02
Actor organization,
17:03
but at the same time they can be Assets
17:06
in helping to mitigate risk.
17:08
So as we see risk management is the key to cybersecurity.
17:11
So now let's go
17:12
through a scenario to actually understand
17:14
how cybersecurity actually
17:16
defend an organization against very manipulative cybercrime.
17:20
So cyber crime
17:21
as we all know is a global problem
17:22
that's been dominating the new cycle.
17:24
It poses a threat to individual security
17:27
and an even bigger threat to large International companies
17:30
Banks and government today's organized cybercrime.
17:33
Part of Shadows loan hackers of Fast
17:35
and Now large organized crime Rings function like startups
17:38
and often employ highly trained developers
17:40
were constantly innovating new online adapt
17:42
most companies have
17:43
preventative security software to stop these types of attacks,
17:46
but no matter how secure we are cyber crime is going to happen.
17:50
So meet Bob,
17:51
he's a chief security officer for a company
17:53
that makes a mobile app to help customers track
17:56
and manage their finances.
17:58
So security is a top priority.
18:00
So Bob's company has an activity response.
18:02
Platform in place that automates the entire cybersecurity process
18:06
the ARP software integrates all the security
18:09
and ID software needed to keep a large company
18:12
like Bob's secured into a single dashboard
18:14
and acts as a hub
18:15
for the people processes
18:17
and Technology needed to respond to and contain cyber doll.
18:20
Let's see how this platform works in the case
18:23
of a security breach
18:24
while Bob is out
18:25
on a business trip irregular activity occurs
18:28
on his account as
18:29
a user Behavior analytic engine that monitors account activity.
18:32
Recognize a suspicious Behavior involving late-night logins
18:36
and unusual amounts of data being downloaded.
18:39
This piece of software is the first signal
18:41
that something is wrong
18:42
and alert is sent to the next piece of software in the chain,
18:45
which is the security information
18:47
and event management system.
18:49
Now the ARP can orchestrate a chain of events
18:52
that ultimately prevents the company from encountering
18:55
a serious security disaster the ARP connects
18:58
to a user directory software
19:00
that Bob's company uses.
19:01
Which immediately Cognizes the user accounts belong
19:04
to an executive
19:05
who is out on a business trip
19:06
and then proceeds to lock his account.
19:09
The ARP sends the incident
19:10
IP address to threat intelligence software
19:13
which identifies the dress
19:14
as a suspected malware civil as each piece
19:17
of security software runs.
19:19
The findings are recorded in the ARP s incident,
19:22
which is already busy creating a set of instructions
19:25
called A playbook
19:26
for a security analyst to follow The analyst
19:29
and locks Bob's a bounce and changes his passwords this time.
19:33
The software has determined the attempted attack came
19:36
from a well-known cyber crime organization
19:38
using stolen credentials.
19:39
Bob's credentials were stolen
19:41
when the hacker found a vulnerability in his company's
19:44
firewall software and use it to upload a malware infected file.
19:48
Now that we know
19:49
how the attack happened the analyst uses
19:51
the ARP and identifies
19:53
and patches all the things the ARP uses information
19:56
from endpoint tool to determine
19:58
Which machines need to be patched recommends
20:00
how to pass them and then allows the analyst to push the batches
20:04
to all the computers and mobile devices instantly.
20:07
Meanwhile Bob has to allow the legal Departments
20:10
of the breach
20:10
and the ARP instantly notifies the correct version
20:13
of the situation and the status of the incident
20:16
after the attack is contained
20:18
and Bob's account is secured the analyst
20:20
and communicates which data may have been stolen or compromised
20:24
during the incident.
20:25
He identifies which geography is jurisdiction.
20:28
And Regulatory Agencies cover
20:30
the users and informations affected by the adapter.
20:33
Then the ARB creates a series of tasks.
20:35
So the organization can notify the affected parties and follow
20:39
all relevant compliances
20:40
and liability procedures in the past a security breach.
20:44
This large would have required Bob's company
20:46
to involve several agencies
20:48
and third parties to solve the problem a process
20:50
that could have taken months or longer.
20:53
But in a matter of hours the incident response platform
20:56
organized all of the people processes.
20:58
Has and Technology to identify and contain the problem find
21:02
the source of the attack fix the vulnerability
21:05
and notify all affected parties
21:07
and in the future Bob and his team will be able to turn
21:10
to cognitive security tools.
21:12
These tools will read and learn from tens of thousands
21:15
of trusted publication blogs and other sources of information.
21:18
This knowledge will uncover new insights and patterns
21:21
and dissipate an isolate and minimize attacks
21:24
as they happen and immediately recommend actions
21:26
for Security Professionals to take Keeping data safe
21:29
and companies like pops out of the headlines.
21:36
Cryptography is essentially important because it allows
21:39
you to securely protect data
21:40
that you don't want anyone else to have access to it is used
21:43
to protect corporate Secrets secure classified information
21:47
and to protect personal information
21:48
to guard against things like identity theft
21:51
and today's video is basically going to be
21:53
about cryptography now
21:54
before we actually jump into the session.
21:56
Let me give you guys a brief on the topics
21:58
that we're going to cover today.
21:59
So first of all,
22:00
we're going to cover what is cryptography
22:01
through the help of a very simplistic scenario,
22:04
then we are going to go through the classifications of Rafi and
22:07
how the different classification algorithm works in the end.
22:10
I'm going to show you guys a Nifty demo on
22:12
how a popular algorithm called RSA actually works.
22:16
So let's get started.
22:17
Now.
22:18
I'm going to take the help of an example or a scenario
22:20
to actually explain.
22:22
What is cryptography.
22:23
All right.
22:24
So let's say we have a person and let's call him Andy
22:27
now suppose Andy sends a message to his friend Sam who's
22:30
on the other side of the world now,
22:32
obviously he wants this message to be private
22:35
and nobody else should Have access to the message now.
22:38
He uses a public forum.
22:39
For example the internet for sending this message.
22:42
The goal is to actually secure this communication.
22:44
And of course we have to be secured against someone now,
22:48
let's say there is a smart guy called Eve
22:50
who is secretly got access to your Communication channel
22:53
since this guy has access to your communication.
22:55
He can do much more than just eavesdrop.
22:57
For example, you can try to change the message in itself.
23:01
Now this is just a small example.
23:03
What if Eve actually gets access to your private information.
23:06
Well that could actually result in a big catastrophe.
23:09
So, how can an D be sure
23:11
that nobody in the middle could access the message center sound.
23:14
The goal here is to make communication secure and that's
23:17
where cryptography comes in.
23:19
So what exactly is cryptography?
23:21
Well cryptography is the practice
23:23
and the study of techniques for securing communication
23:26
and data in the presence of adversaries.
23:28
So, let me take a moment to explain
23:30
how that actually happens.
23:31
Well, first of all, we have a message.
23:34
This message is firstly converted into a Eric form
23:37
and then this numeric form is applied with a key
23:40
called an encryption key
23:41
and this encryption key is used in encryption algorithm.
23:45
So once the numeric message
23:46
and the encryption key has been applied
23:48
in an encryption algorithm.
23:50
What we get is called a cipher text.
23:52
Now this Cipher text is sent over the network
23:55
to the other side of the world
23:57
where the other person whose message is intended
23:59
for will actually use a decryption key and use
24:02
the ciphertext as a parameter of a decryption algorithm.
24:06
And then he'll get
24:07
what we actually send as a message and
24:09
if some error had actually occurred he'd get an arrow.
24:13
So let's see
24:13
how cryptography can help secure the connection between Andy
24:16
and sound so the protect his message
24:19
and the first converts his readable message
24:21
to an unreadable form here.
24:23
He converts a message to some random numbers
24:26
and after that he uses
24:27
a key to encrypt his message after applying this key
24:30
to the numerical form of his message.
24:32
He gets a new value in cryptography.
24:35
We call this ciphertext.
24:36
So now if Andy sends the ciphertext
24:38
or encrypted message over Communication channel,
24:41
he won't have to worry
24:42
about somebody in the middle of discovering the private message.
24:45
Even if somebody manages to discover the message,
24:47
he won't be able to decrypt the message
24:49
without having a proper key to unlock this message.
24:52
So suppose Eve here discovers the message
24:54
and he somehow manages to tamper with the message
24:57
and message finally reaches some Sam would need a key
25:00
to decrypt the message to recover the original plaintext.
25:03
So using the key he would convert a cipher.
25:06
X2 numerical value corresponding
25:08
to the plain text now after using the key for decryption,
25:11
what will come out is the original plain text message
25:14
or an adult now this error is very important.
25:16
It is the way Sam knows
25:18
that message sent by Andy is not the same as a message
25:21
that you receive.
25:22
So the error in a sense tells us
25:23
that Eve has tampered with the message.
25:26
Now, the important thing to note here is
25:28
that in modern cryptography the security
25:30
of the system purely relies on keeping the encryption
25:33
and decryption key secret based on the type
25:35
of keys and encryption.
25:36
Algorithms cryptography
25:37
is classified under the following categories.
25:40
Now cryptography is broadly classified
25:42
under two categories namely
25:44
symmetric key cryptography and a symmetric key cryptography
25:47
popularly also known as public key cryptography.
25:50
Now symmetric key cryptography
25:52
is further classified as classical cryptography
25:55
and modern cryptography
25:57
further drilling down classical cryptography is divided into two
26:01
which is transposition cipher
26:03
and substitution Cipher on the other hand modern cryptography.
26:06
He is divided into stream Cipher
26:08
and block Cipher in the upcoming slides
26:11
are broadly explain all these types of cryptography.
26:14
So let's start with symmetric key cryptography first.
26:17
So symmetric key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography
26:20
that use the same cryptographic keys for broad encryption
26:24
of plaintext and decryption
26:25
of ciphertext the keys may be identical
26:28
or there may be some simple transformation to go
26:31
between the two keys the keys
26:33
in practice represent a shared secret
26:35
between two or more parties
26:37
that can be used to maintain
26:38
a private information link this requirement
26:41
that both parties have access
26:43
to the secret key is not the main drawbacks
26:45
of symmetric key encryption in comparison
26:48
to public key encryption also
26:50
known as a symmetric key encryption now
26:52
symmetric key cryptography
26:54
is sometimes also called secret key cryptography
26:57
and the most popular symmetric key system is
26:59
the data encryption standards,
27:01
which also stands for D EAS next up.
27:03
We're going to discuss transposition Cipher.
27:06
So in cryptography
27:07
a transposition cipher is a method of encryption
27:10
by which the positions held by units of plain text,
27:13
which are commonly characters are groups
27:15
of characters are shifted according to a regular system
27:18
so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation
27:21
of the plain text.
27:22
That is the order of units is changed.
27:25
The plaintext is reordered now,
27:27
mathematically speaking a bijective function is used
27:30
on the characters position
27:31
to encrypt and an inverse function to decrypt.
27:34
So as you can see
27:34
that there is an example All on the slide.
27:37
So on the plain text side, we have a message,
27:40
which says meet me after the party.
27:42
Now.
27:42
This has been carefully arranged in the encryption Matrix,
27:45
which has been divided into six rows and the columns.
27:49
So next we have a key
27:51
which is basically for to 165 and then
27:54
we rearranged by looking at the plain text Matrix
27:57
and then we get the cipher text
27:59
which basically is some unreadable gibberish
28:01
at this moment.
28:02
So that's how this whole algorithm works
28:04
on the other hand
28:05
when the ciphertext Being converted into the plain text
28:08
The plaintext Matrix is going to be referred
28:10
and it can be done very easily moving on.
28:13
We are going to discuss substitution Cipher.
28:15
So substitution of single letter separately simple substitution
28:19
can be demonstrated
28:20
by writing out the alphabets
28:22
in some order to represent the substitution.
28:24
This is termed a substitution alphabet the cipher
28:27
the alphabet may be shifted
28:29
or reversed creating the Caesar
28:31
and upstage Cipher respectively or scrambled
28:34
in a more complex fashion.
28:36
In which case it is called a mixed Alpha bit
28:38
or deranged alphabet
28:39
traditionally mixed alphabets may be created by first writing
28:43
out keyword removing repeated letters in it.
28:45
Then writing all the remaining letters in the alphabet
28:48
in the usual order now consider this example shown
28:51
on the slide using the system.
28:53
We just discussed the keyword zebras gives
28:55
us the following alphabets from the plain text alphabet,
28:58
which is a to z.
28:59
So the ciphertext alphabet
29:00
is basically zebras Then followed by all the alphabets.
29:03
We have missed out in the zebra word.
29:05
So as you guys,
29:06
Can see it's zebras followed by s c d e f g h
29:09
and so on now suppose we were to actually
29:12
encrypt a message using this code.
29:14
So as you guys can see
29:15
on the screen, I've shown you an example,
29:17
which is a message flee at once.
29:18
We are discovered is being actually
29:20
encrypted using this code.
29:22
So if you guys can see out here the F letter
29:25
actually corresponds to S.
29:28
And then the L letter actually corresponds
29:31
to I out here then we actually get the cipher text which is Si
29:36
a a is that you using the code
29:38
and the process that I just discussed now traditionally,
29:41
the cipher text is written out in blocks
29:44
of fixed length omitting punctuations and spaces.
29:46
This is done to help avoid transmission errors to disguise
29:49
the word boundaries from the plain text.
29:52
Now these blocks are called groups
29:53
and sometimes a group count.
29:55
That is the number of groups is given as an additional
29:57
check now five-letter groups are traditional
30:00
as you guys can see
30:01
that we have also divided our ciphertext into groups
30:04
of five and this dates back.
30:06
Back to when messages were actually used
30:08
to be transmitted by Telegraph.
30:10
Now if the length
30:11
of the message happens not to be divisible by 5.
30:14
It may be padded at the end with nulls
30:16
and these can be any characters
30:18
that can be decrypted to obvious nonsense.
30:20
So the receiver can easily spot them
30:23
and discard them next on our list is stream Cipher.
30:27
So a stream Cipher is a method
30:29
of encrypting text to produce Cipher text
30:31
in which a cryptographic key
30:33
and algorithm are applied to each binary digit
30:36
in a data stream one bit at a time.
30:38
This method is not much used in modern cryptography.
30:41
The main alternative method is block Cipher in which a key
30:44
and algorithm are applied
30:46
to block of data rather than individual bits in a stream.
30:49
Okay.
30:49
So now that we've spoken about block Cipher let's go
30:52
and actually explain what block
30:53
Cipher does a block Cipher is an encryption method that
30:57
A deterministic algorithm
30:58
for the symmetric key to encrypt a block
31:01
of text rather than encrypting one bit at a time as
31:03
in stream ciphers.
31:05
For example, a common block Cipher AES encryption
31:08
128-bit blocks with a key of predetermined length.
31:11
That is either 128 192 or 256 bits in length.
31:15
Now block ciphers
31:16
are pseudo-random permutation families
31:18
that operate on the fixed size of block of bits.
31:21
These prps our function
31:22
that cannot be differentiated from completely
31:25
random permutation
31:26
and thus are A reliable and been proven to be unreliable
31:29
by some Source.
31:30
Okay.
31:30
So now it's time
31:31
that we discussed some asymmetric cryptography.
31:34
So asymmetric cryptography also
31:36
known as public key cryptography is any cryptography system
31:40
that uses pair of keys,
31:41
which is a public key which may be disseminated widely
31:44
and private Keys
31:45
which are known only to the owner.
31:47
This accomplishes two functions authentication
31:50
where the public key verify is
31:51
that a holder of the paired private key send the message
31:54
and encryption where only the paired private key holder.
31:57
Decrypt the message encrypted
31:58
with the public key and a public key encryption system.
32:02
Any person can encrypt a message using the receivers public key
32:05
that encrypted message can only be decrypted
32:07
with the receivers private key.
32:09
So to be practical
32:10
the generation of public and private key pair
32:12
must be computationally economical the strength
32:15
of a public key cryptography system relies
32:17
on computational efforts required to find the private key
32:20
from its paid public key.
32:22
So effective security
32:23
only requires keeping the private key private
32:25
and the public key can be a openly distributed
32:28
without compromising security.
32:29
Okay.
32:30
So now that I've actually shown you guys
32:31
how cryptography actually works and how
32:33
the different classifications are actually applied.
32:36
Let's go and do something interesting.
32:38
So you guys are actually watching this video
32:41
on YouTube right now.
32:43
So if you guys actually go
32:45
and click on the secure part besides the URL you
32:48
can actually go and view the digital certificates
32:50
that are actually used out here.
32:52
So click on certificates
32:54
and you'll see the details in the details.
32:57
Up.
32:57
Now as you guys can see the signature algorithm
33:00
that is used
33:01
for actually securing YouTube is being shot 256 with RSA
33:06
and RC is a very very common encryption algorithm
33:09
that is used
33:09
throughout the internet then the signature hash algorithm
33:12
that is being used is sha-256.
33:15
And the issue is Googling internet Authority
33:18
and you can get a lot of information
33:20
about sites and all their Authority Key identifiers
33:23
or certificate policies the key usage and a lot of thing
33:27
about security just from this small little button audio.
33:31
Also, let me show you
33:32
a little how public key encryption actually works.
33:35
So on the side,
33:37
which is basically cobwebs dot CSV or UGA dot edu.
33:40
You can actually demo out public key encryption.
33:44
So suppose we had to send a message first we would need
33:47
to generate keys.
33:49
So as you can see,
33:50
I just click generate keys and it got me two keys,
33:53
which is one is the public key,
33:54
which I will distribute for the network and one.
33:57
Private key which I will actually keep secret to myself.
34:00
Now.
34:01
I want to send a message saying hi there.
34:04
When is the exam tomorrow?
34:07
So now we are going to encrypt it using the public key
34:11
because that's exactly what's distributed.
34:14
So now as you can see we have got our ciphertext saw
34:17
this huge thing right out here is ciphertext
34:20
and absolutely makes no sense whatsoever now suppose we were
34:24
to actually then
34:25
decrypt the message we would Would use the private key
34:28
that goes along with our account and we would decode the message
34:31
and as you guys can see voila we have hi there
34:34
when the exam tomorrow.
34:35
So we are actually sent a message
34:37
on the internet in a very secure fashion above that.
34:40
There's also our essay that needs some explaining
34:43
because I had promised that to now RSA is a very
34:46
very commonly used algorithm
34:47
that is used throughout the internet
34:49
and you just saw it being used by YouTube.
34:51
So it has to be common.
34:53
So RSA has a very unique way of applying this algorithm.
34:57
There are many actual parameters
34:58
that you actually need to study.
35:00
Okay.
35:00
So now we're actually going to discuss Odyssey,
35:03
which is a very popular algorithm that is used
35:05
for of the internet.
35:06
And you also saw
35:07
that it's being used by YouTube right now.
35:09
So this cryptosystem is one of the initial system.
35:12
It remains most employed cryptosystem even today
35:15
and the system was invented by three Scholars,
35:17
which is Ron rivest ADI Shamir and Len adleman
35:21
hence the name RSA and we will see the two aspects
35:25
of the RSA cryptosystem.
35:27
Firstly generation of key pair
35:28
and secondly encryption decryption algorithms.
35:31
So each person or a party
35:33
who desires to participate
35:34
in communication using encryption needs to generate
35:36
a pair of keys namely public key and private key.
35:39
So the process followed in the generation of keys is
35:42
as follows first,
35:43
we have to actually calculate
35:45
n now n is actually given by multiplying p and Q
35:48
as you guys can see out here.
35:50
So p and Q are supposed to be very large prime numbers so
35:54
out here P will be 35,
35:56
but Are some very strong encryption we
35:58
are going to choose very large prime numbers.
36:01
Then we actually have to calculate Phi L Phi is you
36:04
can see the formula goes is p minus 1
36:06
into Q minus 1 and this helps us determine
36:09
for the encryption algorithm.
36:11
Now, then we have to actually
36:13
calculate e now he must be greater than 1
36:15
and less than Phi
36:17
which is p minus 1
36:18
into Q minus 1 and there must be no common factors for e +
36:21
5 except for one.
36:23
So in other words,
36:24
they must be co-prime to each other.
36:26
Now to form the public key the pair of numbers
36:29
n and E from the RSA public Key System.
36:32
This is actually made public and is distributed
36:35
throughout the network interestingly though,
36:37
N is a part of the public key and the difficulty
36:40
in factorizing a large prime number ensures
36:43
that the attacker cannot find in finite time.
36:45
The two primes that is p and Q
36:47
that is used to obtain n this actually ensures the strength
36:50
of RSA now in the generation of the private key.
36:54
The private key D is It from p q and E for given n and E.
36:59
There is a unique number D. Now.
37:02
The number D is the inverse of B modulo 5.
37:05
This means that D is a number less than five such that
37:08
when multiplied by E.
37:10
It gives one.
37:11
So let's go and actually fill up these numbers.
37:14
So n should be 35 out Hill
37:17
and if we generate them we get the value of V,
37:21
which is 24,
37:21
which is basically 4 into 6,
37:24
and then we should also get It's now he should be co-prime.
37:28
So we are going to give it 11 as 11 is co-prime to both.
37:32
So now for the actual encryption part we have to put in p
37:36
and N out here
37:38
so he out here for us is 11
37:40
and N is 35 and then we are going to pick a letter
37:45
to actually Cipher
37:46
which is a and then we're going to encode it as a number.
37:50
So as you guys can see we've encoded as
37:53
one and out here now.
37:56
After we've given the message it's numerical form.
37:59
We click on encryption
38:00
and we get it now to actually decrypt the message.
38:03
We are going to need d and n now D for us was 5
38:07
and N was 35 so 5 and 35
38:12
and then we're going to take encrypted message
38:15
from above and we're going to decrypt this message.
38:18
So after you decrypt it,
38:20
we have the numerical form of the plaintext
38:22
and then decode the messages click here decode messages.
38:26
And as you guys can see we have decoded the message using RSA.
38:29
So guys that's how I receive Oaks.
38:32
I explained all the factors
38:34
that we actually use in our essay from n25 to e to D.
38:39
And I hope you understood a part of it
38:41
if y'all are still
38:42
more interested y'all can actually research a lot
38:45
on our say it's a very in-depth cryptography system p
38:48
and N now D for us was 5 and N was 35 so 5 and 35.
38:56
And then we're going to take encrypted message
38:59
from above and we're going to decrypt this message.
39:02
So after you decrypted we have the numerical form
39:05
of the plaintext
39:07
and then decode the messages click here decode message.
39:10
And as you guys can see we have decoded the message using RSA.
39:14
So guys, that's how I receive books.
39:17
I explained all the factors
39:19
that we actually use in our essay from n25 to e to D.
39:23
And I hope you understood a part of it.
39:26
If y'all are still
39:27
more interested y'all can actually research a lot
39:29
on our say it's a very in-depth cryptography system just
39:38
as pollution was a side effect of the Industrial Revolution.
39:41
So are the many security vulnerabilities
39:43
that come with the increase internet connectivity
39:46
cyber attacks are exploitations
39:47
of those vulnerabilities for the most part individuals
39:51
and businesses have found ways to counter cyber attacks using
39:54
a variety of security measures.
39:56
And just Good Old Common Sense.
39:58
We are going to examine eight
39:59
of the most common cyber security threats
40:01
that your business could face and the ways to avoid them.
40:04
So before we actually jump into the session,
40:07
let me give you how the session will actually work.
40:09
We are going to discuss the most 8 common cyber threats.
40:12
We're going to discuss in particular what they are
40:15
how the threat works and how to protect yourself.
40:17
Okay.
40:18
So now let's jump
40:19
in now cyber attacks are taking place all the time.
40:22
Even as we speak the security of some organization big or small.
40:26
All is being compromised.
40:27
For example,
40:28
if you visit this site out here that is threat Cloud.
40:31
You can actually view all the cyber attacks
40:34
that are actually happening right now.
40:35
Let me just give you a quick demonstration of
40:38
how that looks like.
40:39
Okay, so as you guys can see out here,
40:41
these are all the places that are being compromised right now.
40:44
The red Parts actually show us the part
40:47
that is being compromised and the yellow places
40:50
actually show us from where it's being compromised from.
40:53
Okay, as you guys can see now
40:55
that someone from Madeline's is actually attacking this place
40:58
and someone from USA was attacking Mexico.
41:01
It's a pretty interesting site
41:02
and actually gives you a scale of how many cyber attacks
41:05
are actually happening all the time in the world.
41:07
Okay now getting back I think looking at all these types
41:10
of cyber attacks.
41:11
It's only necessary
41:12
that we educate ourselves about all the types
41:14
of cyber threats that we have.
41:16
So these are the eight cyber threats
41:18
that we're going to be discussing today firstly.
41:20
We're going to start off with malware.
41:22
So malware is an all-encompassing term.
41:26
Or a variety of cyber attacks including Trojans viruses
41:29
and worms malware is simply defined as code
41:32
with malicious intent
41:33
that typically steals data
41:35
or destroy something on the computer.
41:38
The way malware goes about doing its damage can be helpful
41:41
in categorizing what kind of malware you're dealing with.
41:44
So let's discuss it.
41:45
So first of all viruses like the biological namesakes viruses
41:49
attach themselves to clean files
41:51
and infect other clean files and they can spread
41:53
uncontrollably damaging a systems core functionality.
41:56
I'm deleting or corrupting files.
41:58
They usually appear as executable files
42:00
that you might have downloaded from the internet.
42:02
Then there are also Trojans.
42:03
Now this kind
42:04
of malware disguises itself as legitimate software
42:07
or is included in legitimate software that can be tampered
42:10
with it tends to act discreetly and creates back doors
42:13
in your security to let other malware sin.
42:16
Then we have worms worms.
42:17
In fact entire networks of devices either local
42:20
or across the Internet by using the Network's interfaces.
42:23
It uses each consecutive infected machine.
42:26
To infect more and then we have botnets and such
42:28
where botnets are networks of infected computers
42:31
that are made to work together
42:33
under the controller of an attacker.
42:35
So basically you can encounter malware
42:37
if you have some OS vulnerabilities or
42:39
if you download some legitimate software from somewhere
42:42
or you have some other email attachment
42:44
that was compromised with
42:46
Okay.
42:46
So how exactly do you remove malware
42:49
or how exactly do you fight against it?
42:51
Well, each form of malware has its own way of infecting
42:54
and damaging computers
42:56
and data and so each one
42:57
requires a different malware removal method.
42:59
The best way to prevent malware is to avoid clicking on links
43:02
or downloading attachments from unknown senders.
43:05
And this is sometimes done
43:06
by deploying a robust and updated firewall
43:08
which prevents the transfer of large data files
43:11
over the network in a hope to be doubt attachments
43:13
that may contain malware.
43:15
It's also important oughtn't to make sure
43:17
your computer's operating system
43:18
whether it be Windows Mac OS Linux uses the most
43:21
up-to-date security updates
43:23
and software programmers update programs frequently
43:26
to address any holes or weak points,
43:28
and it's important to install all these updates as
43:30
well as to decrease your own system weaknesses.
43:33
So next up on our list of cyber threats we have fishing.
43:36
So what exactly is fishing
43:38
well often posing as a request for data
43:41
from a trusted third party phishing attacks
43:44
are sent via email
43:45
and ask Those to click on a link
43:47
and enter their personal data phishing emails have gotten
43:50
much more sophisticated in recent years
43:53
and making it difficult
43:54
for some people to discern a legitimate request
43:56
for an information
43:58
from a false one now phishing emails often fall
44:00
into the same category as spam but are way more harmful
44:04
than just a simple ad
44:05
so how exactly does fishing work.
44:08
Well most people associate fishing with email message
44:12
that spoof or mimic Bank credit card companies
44:15
or other Genesis like Amazon eBay
44:17
and Facebook these messages look at entik and attempt
44:20
to get victims to reveal their personal information.
44:23
But email messages are
44:25
only one small piece of a phishing scam
44:27
from beginning to end the process involves five steps.
44:30
The first step is planning the Fisher
44:32
must decide which business to Target and determine
44:35
how to get email addresses
44:36
for the customers of that business.
44:38
Then they must go through the setup phase.
44:41
Once they know which business to spoof and who their victims
44:44
are fissures create methods for Living the messages
44:47
and collecting the data then they have to execute the attack.
44:50
And this is the step.
44:51
Most people are familiar with that is the fishes
44:54
and the phony message
44:55
that appears to be from a reputable Source
44:57
after that the Fisher records
44:59
the information the victims enter into the web page
45:01
or pop-up windows and in the last step,
45:04
which is basically identity theft and fraud the Fisher's use
45:07
the information they've gathered to make illegal purchases
45:10
or otherwise commit fraud
45:11
and as many as 1/4 of the victims never fully recover.
45:14
So how exactly can Can you be actually preventing yourself
45:18
from getting fished?
45:19
Well, the only thing that you can do is being aware
45:22
of how phishing emails actually work.
45:24
So first of all,
45:25
a phishing email has some very specific properties.
45:29
So firstly you will have something
45:31
like a very generalized way
45:32
of addressing someone liked your client then your message
45:36
will not be actually from a very reputable source so out here
45:40
as you can see it's written as Amazon on the label,
45:43
but if you actually inspect the email address that Came
45:46
from its from management at Maison Canada dot C A
45:49
which is not exactly a legitimate Amazon address.
45:52
Third.
45:52
You can actually hover over the redirect links and see
45:55
where they actually redirect you to now this redirects me
45:59
to www.facebook.com zone.com
46:01
as you can see out here.
46:03
So basically, you know,
46:04
this is actually a phishing email and you should actually
46:07
report this email to your administrators
46:09
or anybody else
46:10
that you think is supposed to be concerned with this also.
46:13
Let me give you guys a quick demonstration.
46:16
Chinon how fishing actually works from the perspective
46:19
of an attacker.
46:21
So first of all,
46:22
I have actually created a phishing website for
46:26
harvesting Facebook credentials.
46:29
I simply just took the source code
46:31
of the Facebook login page
46:33
and paste it and then made a back-end code in PHP
46:37
which makes a log file of all the Facebook passwords
46:40
that get actually entered onto the fishing page now.
46:44
I've also sent myself an email.
46:46
As to make sure this looks legitimate,
46:48
but this is only for spreading awareness.
46:51
So please don't use this method for actually
46:53
harvesting credentials.
46:55
That's actually a very legal thing to do.
46:57
So, let's get started.
46:58
First of all,
46:59
you will go to your email and see
47:01
that you'll get some emails saying your Facebook credentials
47:04
have been compromised.
47:06
So when you open it, it looks pretty legit.
47:09
Well, I haven't made it look all that legit.
47:11
It should look legit.
47:12
But the point out here is to actually make you aware
47:15
of how this works.
47:16
So as you guys can see it says Dear client we have
47:18
strong reasons to believe
47:19
that your credentials may have been compromised
47:21
and might have been used by someone else.
47:23
We have locked your Facebook account.
47:25
Please click here to unlock sincerely
47:28
Facebook associate Dean.
47:30
So if we actually click here,
47:32
we are actually redirected to a nice-looking Facebook page,
47:36
which is exactly
47:37
how Facebook looks like when you're logging in now suppose.
47:41
I were to actually log into my Facebook account,
47:43
which I won't I'll just use some brand my
47:46
Like this is an email addres gmail.com and let's put
47:52
password as admin 1 2 3
47:54
and we click login now
47:56
since my Facebook is actually already logged in it will just
48:00
redirect to facebook.com
48:01
and you might just see me logged in but on a normal computer
48:05
is just redirect you to www.facebook.com,
48:08
which should just show this site again.
48:10
Okay.
48:11
So once I click login out here all
48:13
that the backend code that I've written in PHP.
48:16
PHP out here will do is
48:18
that it's going to take all the parameters
48:20
that have entered into this website.
48:22
That is my email address
48:24
and the password and just generate a log file about it.
48:27
So let's just hit login and see what happens.
48:29
So as you guys can see I've been redirected
48:32
to the original Facebook page
48:34
that is not meant for fishing and on my system audio.
48:39
I have a log file
48:41
and this log file will show exactly
48:43
as you can see are fished out the email address.
48:46
This is an email addres
48:47
gmail.com and it's also showed the password.
48:50
That is admin one two three.
48:51
So this is how exactly fishing works you enter an email address
48:56
and you're entering the email address
48:58
on a phishing website.
48:59
And then it just redirects you to the original site.
49:02
But by this time you've already compromised your credentials.
49:05
So always be careful when dealing with such emails.
49:08
So now jumping back
49:09
to our session the next type of cyber attacks.
49:11
We're going to discuss is password adducts.
49:14
So an attempt to obtain
49:15
or decrypt a user's password
49:17
for illegal use is exactly what a password attack is
49:21
Hackers can use cracking programs dictionary attacks
49:24
and passwords Nippers
49:25
and password attacks password cracking refers
49:28
to various measures used to discover computer passwords.
49:31
This is usually accomplished by recovering passwords
49:34
from data stored in or transported
49:35
from a computer system password cracking is done by
49:38
either repeatedly guessing the password usually
49:41
through a computer algorithm in which the computer
49:43
tries numerous combinations.
49:44
Nations under the password is successfully discovered now
49:47
password attacks can be done for several reasons,
49:50
but the most malicious reason is
49:51
in order to gain unauthorized access
49:53
to a computer
49:54
with the computers owners awareness not being in place.
49:57
Now this results
49:58
in cyber crime such as stealing passwords for the purpose
50:01
of accessing Bank information.
50:03
Now today, there are three common methods
50:05
used to break into a password-protected system.
50:08
The first is a Brute Force attack a hacker
50:10
uses a computer program
50:11
or script to try to login with possible.
50:14
Odd combinations usually starting with the easiest
50:16
to guess password.
50:17
So just think if a hacker has a company list he or she
50:20
can easily guess usernames.
50:22
If even one of the users has a password one, two,
50:24
three, he will quickly
50:25
be able to get in the next our dictionary attacks.
50:28
Now a hacker uses a program
50:30
or script to try
50:31
to login bicycling through the combinations
50:33
of common words in contrast with Brute Force attacks
50:36
where a large proportion key space is searched systematically
50:40
a dictionary attack tries only those possibilities
50:42
which are most likely to succeed.
50:44
Typically derived from a list of words,
50:46
for example a dictionary generally dictionary attacks
50:50
succeed because most people have a tendency to choose passwords
50:53
which are short
50:54
or such as single words found in the dictionaries
50:56
or simple easy predicted variations on words
50:59
such as a pending a digit or so.
51:01
Now the last kind
51:02
of password attacks are used by keylogger tax hacker uses
51:05
a program to track all of the users keystrokes.
51:08
So at the end of the day everything the user has typed
51:11
including the login IDs and passwords have been recorded.
51:14
Added a keylogger attack is different than a brute force
51:17
or dictionary attack in many ways not the least
51:19
of which the key logging program used as a malware
51:22
that must first make it onto the user's device
51:25
and the keylogger attacks are also different
51:27
because stronger passwords
51:28
don't provide much protection against them,
51:31
which is one reason
51:32
that multi-factor authentication is becoming a must-have
51:35
for all businesses and organizations.
51:37
Now, the only way to stop yourself from getting killed
51:40
in the whole password attack conundrum is
51:42
by actually practicing the Best practices
51:45
that are being discussed in the whole industry about passwords.
51:48
So basically you should update your password.
51:50
Regularly.
51:51
You should use alphanumerics
51:53
in your password and you should never use words
51:55
that are actually in the dictionary.
51:57
It's always advisable to use garbage words
51:59
that makes no sense
52:00
for passwords as a just increase your security.
52:03
So moving on we're going to discuss DDOS attacks.
52:08
So what exactly is a DDOS or a Dos attack?
52:12
Well, first of all,
52:13
it stands for distributed denial of service and a Dos attack
52:16
focuses on disrupting the service to a network
52:19
as the name suggests attackers
52:21
and high volume of data of traffic through the network
52:24
until the network becomes overloaded
52:25
and can no longer function.
52:27
So there are a few different ways attackers
52:29
can achieve dos attack,
52:30
but the most common
52:31
is the distributed denial-of-service attack.
52:33
This involves the attacker using multiple computers
52:36
to send the traffic or data
52:38
that will overload the system in many instances a person
52:41
may not even realize
52:42
that his or her computer has been hijacked
52:44
and is contributing
52:45
to the Dos attack now disrupting Services
52:48
can have serious consequences relating to security
52:51
and online access many instances
52:53
of large-scale Dos attacks have been implemented as
52:56
a single sign of protest towards governments
52:58
or individuals and have led
52:59
to severe punishment including major jail time.
53:02
So, how can you Prevent dos attacks against yourself.
53:05
Well, firstly unless your company is huge.
53:08
It's rare that you would be even targeted by an outside group
53:11
or attackers for a Dos attack your site
53:13
or network could still fall victim to one.
53:15
However, if another organization on your network is targeted now
53:19
the best way to prevent an additional breach
53:21
is to keep your system as secure as possible with
53:24
regular software updates online security monitoring
53:27
and monitoring of your data flow to identify any unusual
53:30
or threatening spikes in traffic
53:32
before they become a problem.
53:34
Dos attacks can also be perpetrated by
53:36
simply cutting a table or dislodging a plug
53:38
that connects your website server to the Internet
53:41
so due diligence in physically monitoring.
53:43
Your connections is recommended as well.
53:46
Okay.
53:46
So next up on our list is man-in-the-middle attacks.
53:50
So by impersonating
53:52
the endpoints in an online information exchange the man
53:56
in the middle attack can obtain information from the end user
53:59
and the entity he
54:00
or she is communicating with for example So
54:03
if you are Banking online
54:05
the man in the middle would communicate with you
54:07
by impersonating your bank
54:09
and communicate with the bank by impersonating you the man
54:12
in the middle would then receive all of the information
54:14
transferred between both parties
54:16
which could include sensitive data such as bank accounts
54:19
and personal information.
54:20
So how does it exactly work normally an MI t--
54:24
M gains access
54:25
through an unencrypted wireless access point
54:27
which is basically one
54:29
that doesn't use WEP WPA or any of the other security measures.
54:33
Then they would have to access all the information
54:36
being transferred
54:37
between both parties by actually
54:39
spoofing something called address resolution protocol.
54:42
That is the protocol
54:43
that is used when you are actually connecting
54:45
to your gateway from your computer.
54:47
So how can you exactly prevent MIT am attacks from happening
54:51
against you firstly you have to use an encrypted W AP
54:55
that is an encrypted wireless access point next.
54:58
You should always check the security
55:00
of your connection because
55:01
when somebody is actually trying to To compromise your security.
55:05
He will try to actually strip down the HTTP or hsts
55:09
that is being injected in the website,
55:10
which is basically the security protocols.
55:13
So if something
55:14
like this HTTP is not appearing in your website,
55:16
you're on an insecure website where your credentials
55:19
or your information can be compromised
55:22
and the last and final measure
55:23
that you can actually use is by investing
55:26
in a virtual private Network
55:27
which spoofs your entire IP
55:29
and you can just browse the internet
55:31
with perfect comfort.
55:33
Next up on our list is drive-by downloads.
55:36
So Gone are the days
55:37
where you had to click to accept a download
55:39
or install the software update
55:41
in order to become infected
55:43
now just opening a compromise webpage
55:45
could allow dangerous code to install on your device.
55:49
You just need to visit or drive by a web page without stopping
55:53
or to click accept any software
55:55
at the malicious code can download
55:57
in the background to your device a drive-by download refers
56:00
to the unintentional download of a virus or malicious.
56:03
Software onto your computer
56:04
or mobile device a drive-by download
56:07
will usually take advantage
56:08
or exploit a browser or app or operating system
56:11
that is out of date and has security flaws.
56:14
This initial code
56:15
that is downloaded is often very small and
56:17
since its job is often simply to contact another computer
56:21
where it can pull down the rest of the code
56:23
onto your smartphone tablet
56:24
or other computers often a web page will contain
56:27
several different types of malicious code in hopes
56:29
that one of them will match a weakness on your computer.
56:32
So What is this exactly what But first you visit the site
56:36
and during the three-way handshake connection
56:39
of the TCP IP protocol a back in script is triggered.
56:43
As soon as a connection is made by Al the last ack packet
56:46
is sent a download is also triggered
56:48
and the malware is basically injected into your system.
56:51
Now the best advice I can share about overriding
56:54
drive-by downloads is to avoid visiting websites
56:56
that could be considered dangerous or malicious.
56:59
This includes adult content file sharing websites,
57:02
or Anything that offers you a free trip to the Bahamas
57:06
Now some other tips
57:07
to stay protected include keep your internet browser
57:09
and operating system up-to-date use a saved search protocol
57:13
that once you went to navigate
57:14
to a malicious site and use comprehensive security software
57:18
on all your devices like McAfee all access
57:20
and keeping it up to date.
57:22
Okay, so that was it about drive-by downloads.
57:25
Next up is Mal advertising or malvert izing.
57:28
So malvit sizing is the name we in the security industry
57:32
give to criminally Android advertisements
57:34
which intentionally,
57:35
in fact people and businesses.
57:37
These can be any ad
57:39
on any site often ones which you use as a part
57:42
of your everyday internet usage and it is a growing problem
57:46
as is evident by a recent US Senate report
57:48
and the establishment of bodies
57:50
like trust and ads now whilst the technology being used
57:54
in the background is very Advanced the way presents
57:57
to the person beings infected is simple to all intents
58:00
and purposes the advertisement looks the same.
58:03
Same as any other but has been placed by criminal
58:06
like you can see the mint at out here.
58:08
It's really out of place.
58:09
So you could say it's been made by a criminal now
58:12
without your knowledge a tiny piece of code hidden deep
58:15
in the advertisement is making your computer go
58:18
to the criminal servers these and catalog details
58:21
about your computer
58:22
and its location
58:23
before choosing which piece of malware to send you
58:25
and this doesn't need a new browser window
58:27
and you won't know about it.
58:29
So basically you're redirected to some criminal server.
58:33
Neither injections takes place and voila you're infected.
58:36
It's a pretty dangerous thing to be in.
58:39
So how exactly can you stop ma advertising.
58:41
Well, first of all,
58:43
you need to use an ad blocker,
58:45
which is a very must in this day and age you
58:48
can have ad blocker extensions installed on your browser
58:51
whether it be Chrome Safari
58:53
or Mozilla also regular software updates of your browser
58:56
and other softwares
58:57
that work very fertile to your browser always helps
59:00
and next is some common sense.
59:02
And yeah, Advertisement that is about a lottery
59:05
that's offering you free money is probably going to scam you
59:08
and inject malware to
59:09
so now we click on those ads.
59:11
So the last kind of cyber attacks.
59:14
We are going to discover today and discuss
59:16
about is Rogue software.
59:18
So Rogue security software is a form of malicious software
59:21
and internet fraud that misleads users into believing
59:24
that there is a virus on their computer
59:27
and manipulates them into paying money
59:29
for a fake malware removal tool.
59:31
It is a form of scare where that money.
59:33
Lets users through fear
59:34
and a form of ransomware rock security software has been
59:38
a serious security thread in desktop Computing since 2008.
59:41
So now how does a rogue security software work
59:44
these cams manipulating users
59:46
in to download the program through a variety of techniques.
59:49
Some of these methods include ads offering
59:51
free or trial versions
59:52
of Security Programs often pricey upgrades
59:55
or encouraging the purchase of deluxe versions,
59:58
then also pops warning
59:59
that your computer is infected with the virus
60:01
which encourages you to clean.
60:03
It by clicking on the program
60:05
and then manipulated SEO rankings that put
60:07
infected website as the top hits
60:09
when you search these links then redirect you to a landing page
60:12
that seems your machine is infected
60:14
and encourages you a free trial of the Rogue security program.
60:18
Now once the scareware
60:19
is installed it can steal all your information slow
60:22
your computer corrupt your files disable updates
60:25
for Less timet antivirus softwares
60:27
or even prevent you
60:28
from visiting legitimate security software vendor sites.
60:32
Well talking about prevention.
60:33
The best defense is a good offense.
60:35
And in this case and updated firewall makes sure
60:38
that you have a working one in your office
60:40
that protects you
60:41
and your employees from these type of attacks.
60:44
It is also a good idea to install a trusted antivirus
60:47
or anti-spyware software program
60:49
that can detect threats like these
60:51
and also a general level of distrust on the internet
60:54
and not actually believing anything right off.
60:56
The bat is the way to go teen is infected
60:58
and encourages you a free trial of the Rogue security.
61:02
Program now once the scareware is installed it can steal all
61:05
your information slow your computer corrupt
61:08
your files to siebel updates
61:09
for Less timet antivirus softwares or even prevent you
61:12
from visiting legitimate security software vendor sites.
61:16
Well talking about prevention.
61:17
The best defense is a good offense.
61:19
And in this case and updated firewall makes sure
61:22
that you have a working one in your office that protects you
61:25
and your employees from these type of attacks.
61:28
It is also a good idea to install a trusted antivirus
61:31
or These fiber software program
61:33
that can detect threats like these
61:35
and also a general level of distrust on the internet
61:38
and not actually believing anything right off.
61:40
The bat is the way to go the key word
61:48
of this video is ethical hacking course,
61:51
but in reality,
61:52
it's just an expansive video on the fundamentals
61:56
of ethical hacking.
61:57
There is no such thing
61:59
as an ethical hacking course to be honest
62:01
because snow course
62:02
can teach you a discipline like ethical hacking all the best
62:05
that you can do
62:06
and creating content for ethical hacking is
62:09
that you can tell people
62:10
about the fundamentals are followed in this discipline.
62:13
Okay.
62:14
Now before we start let me just give you
62:16
a general idea of the topics
62:18
that I intend to cover throughout this video.
62:21
Okay now to be honest,
62:23
we're going to cover a pretty broad range of material.
62:26
We are first we're going to be going over
62:28
footprinting and recognitions where you get an idea.
62:31
What's involved in the ethical hacking engagement
62:34
that you're working
62:35
on and information
62:37
about the Target that you're engaged with?
62:39
Then we're going to talk about networking fundamentals
62:42
and here we're going to get our hands dirty with buckets
62:45
and the understanding
62:46
of dcpip at a deeper level and also understanding
62:50
how the different protocols work and why they work that way now.
62:53
We are also going to be talking about cryptography
62:56
where we talk about different cryptography key ciphers.
62:58
We're going to deal with web encryption to SSL
63:01
and And TLS we are also going to talk about certificates
63:05
and the creation of certificates
63:06
and how they actually
63:08
operate we will also talk about public key cryptography
63:11
and we are also scanning an enumeration so nmap
63:14
and dealing with Windows servers
63:16
and using SNMP and ldap and all that sort of stuff.
63:20
Then we're going to be talking about penetration
63:22
where we deal with different ways
63:24
of getting into systems and also go over using Metasploit,
63:27
which is an exploit framework,
63:29
and we're going to talk about how to Use Metasploit
63:33
and you actually get in the systems
63:34
and make use of the exploits
63:36
that they have then we're going to talk about malware's viruses
63:39
and worms and rootkits and all of that sort of stuff.
63:43
We're going to take a look at the different pieces
63:45
of malware and how you would pull that apart
63:47
in order to understand
63:49
what is doing and potentially
63:50
make use of that malware during an ethical hacking engagement.
63:54
Then we're going to talk about different types of denial
63:56
of service attacks or dos attacks
63:58
and the difference between a denial-of-service
64:01
attack and Distributed denial-of-service attack,
64:03
and there is a difference there.
64:05
So we're going to go over this docks now.
64:08
We're also going to go over web application hacking
64:10
and the types of tools
64:11
that you would use during
64:12
web application hacking and the different vulnerabilities
64:15
that web applications have
64:17
and how to make use of these exploits
64:19
and those vulnerabilities.
64:20
We're going to talk about Wireless networking
64:23
how to probe wireless networks
64:25
what wireless networks are doing
64:26
and how to secure wireless networks.
64:28
We're also going to talk
64:29
about a little bit about detection vation.
64:31
And to be honest with you,
64:33
the direction of Asian kind of comes up in a lot
64:35
of different areas through the many of the topics
64:38
that were also
64:39
going to talk about programming programming tax
64:41
and how to protect oneself against programming attacks.
64:45
Okay.
64:45
So that was the number of topics
64:48
that we are actually going to cover through this video.
64:51
Now the approach
64:51
that I'm going to be taking in the series of videos
64:54
is whenever possible.
64:55
We're going to be going to use a Hands-On approach.
64:59
So we're going to show you the actual All tools I'm going
65:02
to make use of and the tools to do some sort of demonstration
65:06
and how they actually work.
65:08
I am a big believer
65:09
in getting your hands dirty as the best way to learn anything.
65:13
So as we go through the series of videos,
65:16
I strongly encourage you to get access to the tools
65:19
that I'm going to be demonstrating wherever
65:21
possible and dig in and get your hands dirty along with me
65:24
and there are places
65:25
where we're going to be going over some theoretical material
65:28
and I'm not a big fan of PowerPoint slides,
65:30
but That are necessary evil
65:33
and order to convey certain types of information.
65:35
So wherever possible I'm going to minimize their use,
65:38
but you will run across places
65:40
where they're just a necessity and we're going to have to go
65:43
through some slides
65:45
where in order to get some particular points
65:47
across they are primarily of a theoretical nature.
65:50
So that's the process that we will be taking
65:52
through this video and I hope you have fun
65:54
as you go along the way.
65:56
Okay.
65:57
So let's begin now the first topic
65:59
that we're going to tackle is what What is hacking?
66:03
Okay, so let us take a trip
66:06
to the early days of hacking the start
66:09
with now the internet engineering task force
66:12
is responsible for maintaining documentation about protocols
66:15
and very specification and processes and procedures
66:19
regarding anything on the internet.
66:21
They have a series of documents called the request for comments
66:24
or the rfc's and according to RFC one three eight nine.
66:28
It says a hacker is a person
66:29
who Delights in having and Intimate understanding
66:33
of the internal workings of a system computers
66:36
and computer networks
66:37
in particular while the expression hackers
66:40
may go back a long time
66:41
and have many different connotations are definitions.
66:45
As far as computers.
66:46
Go.
66:46
Some of the earliest hackers were members
66:48
of the tech Model Railroad Club
66:50
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
66:53
and what those people did and the various things
66:56
that they did and were involved in a detailed and Steven Levy's
66:59
book called hackers for Our purposes now
67:02
for our purposes would be talking
67:04
about other types of hackers.
67:06
Although the spirit of what we do goes back
67:08
to those early days.
67:10
Now, the definition of hacking
67:12
or hackers has changed particularly in the 1980s
67:15
and in part as a result of a couple of people
67:18
namely Robert T Morris who was a Cornell graduate
67:21
who Unleashed a piece of software
67:23
that was called a worm on what was an early version
67:26
of the internet Forum went on to cause a lot of damage
67:29
and create a lot of downtime on Systems across the country
67:33
and across the world.
67:34
Now the Morris worm did end up resulting in something good.
67:38
However, that is computer Emergency Response Team
67:41
at Carnegie Mellon was created primarily
67:43
in response to the mall swarm.
67:45
Now, there's also Kevin mitnick was another well-known hacker
67:48
who was responsible for various acts
67:50
of computer crime over a couple of decades.
67:53
He was the first convicted in 1988.
67:56
So the definition of hacker or hacking move from something
67:59
benign to something far more sinister.
68:01
In popular culture now,
68:03
we see hacking or hackers in all sorts of popular culture.
68:07
We've seen them in hacker movies
68:10
called War Games also the movie hackers.
68:13
Of course.
68:14
You also see in The Matrix movies where you can see
68:17
if you look really closely
68:19
that they are using a tool called nmap,
68:21
which we will get into the use of in great detail later on
68:25
as we go on now.
68:26
It's the movie sneakers and the movie SWAT fish
68:29
and on television
68:31
in other Into other places you can see the agents
68:34
at NCIS regularly doing things like cracking
68:37
complex cryptography in just a matter of seconds or minutes.
68:41
So what is hacking really
68:43
well hacking is about a deep understanding
68:45
of something particularly
68:47
with relation to computers and Computing.
68:49
It's also about exploring and the joy of learning new things
68:53
and understanding them very clearly
68:55
and being able to manipulate those things in ways
68:57
that maybe other people haven't before it's all
69:00
about digging into problems.
69:01
To find out Solutions in creative and interesting ways
69:05
and sometimes finding problems
69:06
where there weren't problems previously
69:09
and that's a little bit about what is hacking.
69:11
Okay.
69:12
So now that we have talked about what exactly is hacking
69:15
and how the meaning
69:16
and conditions of that word has changed over time
69:20
how it came into existence how it was coined.
69:22
Let's go over the reasons that people normally hack.
69:26
Now you may want to hack just for fun
69:28
as discussed previously hacking is a tradition.
69:31
It goes back several decades
69:33
at MIT even preceding the computer too late definition
69:36
of hacking now MIT has a long and storied history of hacking
69:41
and sometimes have a computer to lated nature
69:43
which in this case happens to be true
69:46
and sometimes a fan
69:47
on computer-related nature instance.
69:49
Now here you can see
69:50
that MIT is home page has been hacked
69:53
or you might even say the faced indicate
69:56
that Disney is buying a mighty.
69:58
This was an April Fool's Day prank and 1998.
70:01
Eight.
70:01
And again, this is just the kind of hacking
70:04
that it would do for fun.
70:05
Rather.
70:06
Now.
70:06
Sometimes you might want to hack just to prove
70:09
a political point or any point for that matter in this case.
70:13
Again, Bill Gates had donated some money to the MIT
70:17
which allowed them to have a new building
70:19
and he was coming to MIT to visit
70:22
and give a talk about Microsoft Windows
70:24
and its systems.
70:26
And as you can see the the Windows systems are installed
70:30
in the entryway at the
70:31
Or hacked to be running Linux instead and you can see here.
70:35
That ducks.
70:36
The penguin is saying welcome
70:38
to the William Edge Gates Building again that
70:41
some students who decided
70:42
that they wanted to make a point about Linux and Microsoft
70:45
and windows to Bill Gates
70:47
and they thought hacking was the best way to go about it.
70:50
Sometimes you have just for the challenge.
70:53
Here's an example again at MIT
70:55
where some students turned the facade of a building
70:58
into a Tetris game board.
71:00
Now, this was a reasonably difficult hack
71:03
and the students went
71:04
after it just for the challenge of completing it and it just
71:08
so they could have some pride of ownership
71:10
and to be able to say
71:11
that they were able to pull this off,
71:13
you know, the things that teenagers do to show off
71:16
to other teenagers.
71:17
It just increases with increase
71:19
in scale now in spite of its difficulties
71:22
and its challenges and all the obstacles and planning
71:25
that have to go into it.
71:26
They were able to pull it off
71:28
and now they have those bragging rights.
71:30
So that was one Them and one of the instances
71:33
where somebody would hack just
71:35
for the challenge and for the fun of it.
71:38
Now, sometimes you want to hack to prevent theft
71:41
and this is where we get
71:42
more specifically in the computer-related hackings.
71:46
You see a lot of Articles and stories in the news
71:49
over the last few years about cybercrime
71:51
and here is an example of data theft compromised
71:54
and a few than one-and-a-half million cards
71:57
for Global claimants.
71:58
So there are some attackers
71:59
who got into this company global payment
72:02
and they were able to pull out about a million and a half
72:04
credit card numbers during the intrusion there.
72:07
So what you may want to do is you may want to learn
72:10
how to hack in order to find these holes
72:13
in your systems or applications or employer systems
72:16
so that you can fix these holes and prevent these compromises
72:19
from happening because of the reputation of hit
72:22
that your company takes
72:23
where were things like these happen.
72:25
You have the risk of completely running out of business.
72:28
So just to protect our job to protect Company
72:32
and protect your own desire of business.
72:35
You may just want to learn to hack
72:36
and that's a very good reason.
72:38
Now, you may also want to find all the problems
72:41
that exist in your system
72:42
for putting them out and deploying them
72:44
so that you can keep these attackers from getting in
72:47
and stealing critical or sensitive information.
72:50
Sometimes you may want to hack to get there before the bad guys
72:53
and the same sort of idea is the last one
72:56
where we're just going to talk about and it exactly is
72:59
ethical hacking now.
73:00
We were just talking Talking about how sometimes
73:03
you may want to hack
73:04
into your own system
73:05
before publishing it out to the public.
73:07
Let's take Internet Explorer.
73:09
For example.
73:09
Now Internet Explorer was actually published the public
73:13
with some critical error in the code.
73:15
And these flaws were heavily exploited by people
73:19
who actually found them.
73:20
Now a number of people in the world go out looking
73:23
for these flaws
73:24
and they call themselves security researchers
73:26
and they get in touch with the vendors
73:28
after they found a flaw or a bug and work.
73:31
The vendors to get it fixed
73:33
what they end up with is a bit of reputation.
73:36
They get a name for themselves
73:37
and that name recognition may end up getting them a job
73:41
or some speaking engagements or book deal
73:43
or any number of ways that you could cash in
73:46
on some name recognition from finding the sort of bugs
73:50
and getting them fixed.
73:51
If you want to get there before the bad guys.
73:54
You may think you're helping out a vendor.
73:56
You may want to just make a name for yourself.
73:59
If you want to find these sort of bugs
74:01
before the bad guys do
74:02
because think about the bad guys
74:04
finding then is they don't announce them
74:06
and they don't get them fixed
74:08
and that makes everybody a little less secure.
74:11
Finally may want to protect yourself
74:13
from hacked computer companies and fight cyber criminals,
74:17
and this is new headline from June 18 2012,
74:19
and we're starting to see these sort
74:21
of news headlines show up
74:22
as companies are starting to retaliate against attackers
74:25
in order to retaliate against attackers.
74:28
Now in order to retaliate against Dockers,
74:30
you need to be able to The same sort
74:32
of skills and techniques and knowledge and experience
74:35
that those attackers have
74:37
and where your company may want you to learn to hack
74:40
or the company may want to bring in people
74:43
who are skilled at these sort of activities
74:45
so that they can attack the Dockers
74:47
and hopefully you end up with more Steely exterior
74:51
and you get a reputation for not being a company
74:53
that people wanted to go after those are several reasons.
74:57
And there you go.
74:58
I gave you around a bunch
74:59
of reasons as to why you may want to hack.
75:01
Back for fun prove a point take yourself to protect the company
75:06
to not run out of business
75:08
and along with another bunch of reasons.
75:10
Okay.
75:11
So now that we have talked about why you would want to hack.
75:15
Let's move on to the types of hackers that exist.
75:18
Now we're going to be talking about the different types
75:20
of hacking and the first step of Hawking
75:22
that I want to discuss is ethical hacking
75:24
and ethical hackers,
75:25
which is really
75:26
what we're going to be talking about for the rest
75:28
of these lessons now an ethical hacker is Buddy
75:31
who thinks like a black hat hacker
75:34
or things like somebody
75:35
who is intent on breaking into your systems
75:38
but follows a moral compass
75:39
that's more in line with probably the majority
75:42
of the population.
75:43
So their intent isn't to do bad things their intent
75:47
is look for bad things and get them fixed.
75:49
So that bad things don't happen ethical hackers aren't out
75:53
to destroy anything and they're not out
75:55
the break anything
75:56
unless it's deemed to be acceptable as a part
75:59
of the engagement and also necessary.
76:01
And in order to demonstrate a particular vulnerability
76:04
to the organization that they're working with so
76:07
that's an ethical hacker
76:08
and there's a certification
76:10
that's available from the ec-council.
76:12
It's a certified ethical hacker and you know,
76:14
if you find certifications valuable
76:16
and this sort of thing is what do you want to do?
76:19
We're seeing a set of certified ethical hacker
76:21
may be something you might want to look into now.
76:24
Let's talk about black hat hacker.
76:26
There's a plenty of cases of black hat hackers
76:29
through yours and let's talk about a guy.
76:31
In particular called Kevin mitnick.
76:33
This guy right here is a particularly
76:36
good example probably
76:37
because he was a black hat hacker for a lot of us years.
76:40
His goal was to cause mischief to steal
76:43
where necessary and just to be engaged in the lifestyle
76:46
of being a hacker
76:47
and doing whatever was necessary
76:49
to continue doing whatever it craw doing
76:51
whatever he was doing it cross moral boundaries
76:54
or ethical boundaries.
76:55
And so Kevin mitnick here was involved for well over a decade
76:59
and computer crime
77:00
and was finally picked up by the FBI
77:02
and he was charged
77:03
and prosecuted and he was eventually convicted
77:06
of some of the activities that he was involved with now
77:09
you may be able to argue that Kevin is a gray hat hacker
77:12
and as well and a gray hat hacker is somebody
77:16
who kind of skirts
77:17
the line between black and white hat Hawking
77:19
and white had Hawking is really what
77:21
an ethical hacker is so instead of saying ethical hacker.
77:25
You could say white hat hacker.
77:26
It's the same idea
77:28
of white hat hacker is somebody who acts for good
77:31
if you Think of it like that
77:33
if you want to think of it as a good versus evil
77:36
and what they're really doing is they're in it
77:38
for the technical challenge.
77:39
They're looking to make things better make things
77:42
more efficient improve them in some way on the other hand.
77:45
The black hat hacker is out for the money for the thrill.
77:49
It's really criminal activity
77:51
and a gray hat hacker is somebody who may employ
77:53
the tactics and technique of a black hat hacker,
77:56
but have sort of a white hat
77:58
focus in other words they're going to do Do things
78:01
that may be malicious and destructive in nature,
78:04
but the reason they're doing it is to improve
78:06
the security posture of an organization
78:08
that they're working
78:09
with so you can see
78:11
there's actually a book called gray hat hacking.
78:14
It's a pretty good book and it details a lot
78:16
of the tactics and strategies
78:18
and techniques will be going over in subsequent lessons
78:22
in this video.
78:23
Now one other type of hacking
78:25
that I want to talk about is a thing called hacktivism
78:28
and you'll find hacktivism all over the place
78:31
and Example in the last year
78:33
or so and certainly in recent memory is called loves security.
78:37
Yeah, you heard that right?
78:38
It's called loves security and you can argue
78:41
that lulls is actually a response to another type
78:43
of activism and organization called Anonymous
78:46
started hacking companies
78:48
like Sony to protest their involvement in a lawsuit
78:51
regarding a PlayStation 3 hacker now allow security
78:54
was supposedly testing the treatment of anonymous
78:57
or was hacking in support of this group Anonymous,
79:00
so they hacked number.
79:01
Of companies and the things like pulled information usernames
79:04
and passwords from the databases at these companies and they said
79:08
that the reason was to shine a light on the security
79:10
of these companies
79:11
and also theoretically embarrassed the companies
79:14
with their weak or poor security postures
79:16
and the problem with that
79:18
that they were doing this through were posting information
79:21
that they had found online
79:22
and that information often included details
79:25
about customers for these particular corporations.
79:27
And for an ethical hacker a white hat hacker
79:30
that would cross the boundary.
79:31
Of causing harm.
79:32
So there's no reason
79:33
for me as an ethical hacker to post information
79:36
in a public forum about somebody
79:38
because I could be doing damage to them.
79:40
But in this case law security and Anonymous specifically lot
79:44
of security were engaged in the form of hacktivism
79:46
and what they were doing was not only damaging
79:48
to the corporation
79:49
that certainly was detrimental
79:51
to those people so different types of hackers
79:54
and different types of hacking we've got
79:56
ethical or white hat hacking.
79:58
You've got black hat gray hat and then we finally got Mmm,
80:01
it's really the goal
80:02
and the means that vary from one to the other.
80:05
Okay.
80:05
So now that we've discussed the types of hackers.
80:08
Let's also discuss the skills necessary to become one.
80:11
So what we're going to discuss
80:13
in this part are the different skills
80:14
that are required
80:15
or will be learned as a part of this video.
80:17
So initially just
80:18
for basic Computing you need a basic understanding
80:21
of operating systems and how to work them.
80:23
There are going to be several fundamental types of tasks
80:26
that I won't be going into any detail at all
80:28
or and you need to know how to run programs.
80:31
And do things like open up a command prompt
80:33
without me walking you through and how to do that.
80:36
So I am going to assume
80:37
that you have some basic understanding of how to do
80:40
these sorts of tasks.
80:41
Also, you need an understanding of the basic system software
80:44
and you'll need a basic understanding of how to use
80:47
command line utilities.
80:48
There are a number of tools and programs
80:50
that we're going to be going through this video
80:52
and many of them use the command line now
80:54
whether it's on Windows
80:55
or Linux still need to be familiar with typing
80:58
and being able to run programs from the command line
81:01
and the various command line switches and parameters
81:03
that those programs are types
81:05
of programs are going to use now from a networking perspective.
81:09
You need a basic understanding
81:11
of some simple networking Concepts.
81:13
You need to know what cables are and switches
81:15
and hubs and how systems are networked together.
81:17
You don't really need a deep level of understanding.
81:20
I'll be going through some protocols
81:22
as reasonably deep level
81:23
because I think it's important as
81:25
an ethical hacker to understand
81:26
what's going on at the protocol level
81:29
so that you can know better what you are.
81:31
Going and how to achieve the goals and tasks
81:34
that you have before you so we're going to be going
81:37
over some protocols.
81:38
So just understanding what protocols are
81:40
and how they go together.
81:42
They all sort of things are necessary
81:43
from a networking perspective.
81:45
Now, we're going to also be learning a bunch of life skills.
81:48
Yes, there are some life skills that it's important to have.
81:51
I think the most important one is the ability to accept failure
81:54
and persevere and by that.
81:56
I mean you're going to be just running across several things
81:59
that just don't work the first time around
82:01
and it's going to take a little bit of time
82:03
and stick-to-itiveness to plug away and keep going
82:06
until you get something to work.
82:08
And the way that you get things to work is having
82:11
an ability to problem solve
82:13
and sometimes solving problems requires being
82:15
a little creative.
82:17
Sometimes you need thing out of the box
82:18
and come out a problem
82:20
from a different perspective in order to find a solution
82:23
throughout the course of this video.
82:24
You're going to run across a lot of sticky problems
82:27
through the course of learning about being an ethical hacker
82:30
and just doing the work.
82:31
Because it's not a simple.
82:33
So here's a little recipe for how to do this now go follow
82:37
this recipe every time and you're going to be successful.
82:39
Every situation is different.
82:41
Every system is different.
82:42
You're going to run across some pretty sticky problems
82:45
and you're going to have to just wait and get your hands dirty
82:49
and keep failing and failing and failing and failing
82:51
until you find a way to succeed.
82:53
So I think those skills are very necessary to learn
82:56
how to be an ethical hacker digging through some
82:58
of the material that will be going over in this.
83:01
Yo, as far as what you are going to be learning
83:03
you're going to be learning about how to use a lot of tools.
83:06
You're going to learn networking and by that.
83:08
I mean we're going to be talking about different Protocols
83:11
are evolved involved in networking systems together,
83:14
you're going to learn about security and security
83:16
postures security is the heart and soul of ethical hacking.
83:19
It's why we do ethical hacking
83:21
in order to make systems and networks more secure
83:24
than they were previously.
83:25
That's the goal from a networking perspective.
83:27
We're going to be talking about how to read packets
83:30
from Network captures.
83:31
You're going to be going into TCP IP related protocols
83:34
and fairly significant amount
83:36
of detail and they're going to understand
83:38
how protocols interact with one another.
83:40
So we're going to do all
83:41
that and the reading packets is going to be really important
83:45
and we're going to do a fair amount of that
